# EcommerceApplication
All details about this project were explained in the README file.

This e-commerce project was made in java programming language using the swing library. 
The project works with a database. In order to run the project, you must first add a database connector to the project. 
The database used while coding this project was mysql database. Therefore, the SQL codes inside are written according to MySQL. 
Remember that you can work with any database you want, but if the database you choose is different from Mysql, you may need to change some database codes in the code. 
If you are going to work with mysql, what you will do is very simple, you will only need to change the username, password and dbUrl fields in the 2 classes in the context packet. 
So 6 changes in total. (Do not change the database name ecommerce!!!)
